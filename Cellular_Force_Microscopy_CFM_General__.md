#Cellular Force Microscopy (CFM)

## General Considerations ##

Mechanical measurements of plant cells and tissues impose various technical challenges. The assessment of different parameters, such as turgor pressure, cell wall stiffness or penetration forces, involve a wide range of forces from nanoNewtons to milliNewtons and requested a set of  several devices as discussed above. The topography of plant tissues makes it necessary to equip the force sensors with long probes and to have a wide z-positioning range to reach into the inclinations between turgid cells. A high degree of automation is important to create high-resolution stiffness maps and to measure a large number of samples. The cellular force microscope (CFM) combines the high level of automation and resolution as provided by AFM with the versatility of classic microindentation systems being able to measure in-plane elasticity, which is important to measure growth. The use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based force sensors allow to measure tissue regions that are difficult to reach with cantilever probes. The CFM probes demonstrate negligible hysteresis over their full range of operation and are individually calibrated from the supplier (FemtoTools AG, Switzerland).  Custom-made software allows the control of the positioner and reacts on sensor feedback.

First experiments using the CFM demonstrated that the method is suitable for high-resolution stiffness mapping on onion epidermal cells. A plasmolysed piece of tissue was measured sequentially over several hours during recovery from plasmolysis and revealed changes in topography and stiffness with increasing turgor pressure \cite{Routier-Kierzkowska2012a}.


##CFM Measurements on Pollen Tubes
Stiffness measurements taken under the conditions used by the CFM and other microindentation systems do not only reflect the mechanical properties of the cell wall alone but are strongly influenced by turgor pressure, cell and indenter geometry as well as stresses in the cell wall prior to indentation. Hence, the measured values are referred to as the "apparent stiffness" \cite{Zamir2004}. First experiments on pollen tubes were performed by Vogler and colleagues \cite{Vogler2013a}. CFM measurements on growing, fully turgid lily pollen tubes confirmed the apparent stiffness results from microindenter experiments with a soft apical region and gradually increasing stiffness that reached a plateau 20 Âµm behind the tip. Finite element method (FEM)-based modeling was applied to disentangle the values for turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity by adjusting the material properties of the virtual cell wall until the modeled stiffness curve was in agreement with the measured values. Surprisingly, it was unnecessary to modify the elastic properties in the tip region to get an almost exact match, displaying a steep decrease in the apparent stiffness towards the very tip. This means, in other words, that the stiffness difference between the tip and the shank do not reflect the well-documented changes in cell wall composition but can be explained exclusively by the geometry of the cell and the contact angle between the probe tip and cell surface \cite{Vogler2013a,Routier-Kierzkowska2013a,Bolduc2006a}.

Using a FEM-based modeling approach allows unraveling the effects of turgor pressure and cell wall stiffness without the necessity to measure turgor by another method, i.e., the pressure probe. However, the model relies on the assessment of several geometrical parameters, such as the initial stretch ratio, which is correlated to the wall stress under pressure prior to indentation. This can be easily measured by comparing the diameter of a pollen tube before and after plasmolysis. Cell wall thickness is more difficult to measure. To get accurate values it is necessary to analyse and average electron microscopy images. Since the cell wall shows a certain local variation in thickness it would be ideal, however, to know the thickness at the position of indentation. A method to estimate cell wall thickness from apparent stiffness-indentation curves has been suggested by \citet{Forouzesh2013a} but is not yet accurate enough and at least partially depending on the pressure state of the cell.



##Limitations of the CFM Approach
While the CFM has contributed significantly to the mechanical investigation of pollen tubes and other single plant cells \cite{Vogler_2012,Weber_2015}, experimental challenges still remain in high-throughput measurements of the micromechanics of growing pollen tubes. Firstly, ensuring sufficient substrate adhesion of the growing pollen tube is a major challenge for micro-indentation. While cells, like yeasts or oocytes, that exhibit isotropic or near-isotropic growth, can be immobilized by culturing on solid growth medium \cite{De_2010}, or by trapping in surface-patterned wells \cite{Ng_2007,Kailas_2009} or physical fixation by capillary aspiration \cite{Yu_Sun_2003}, the rapid and three-dimensional nature of pollen tube growth renders such immobilization techniques unusable. Secondly, conventional _in vitro_ growth assays, lead to disordered growth of pollen tubes in all directions, leading to increased operational time to monitor the growth trajectory and position the indentor for measurements at the required spot on the pollen tube \cite{Felekis_2015}. The random tubular growth direction complicates the development of automated tools to pre-plan the position, number of measurement points and trajectory of the microindentor, consequently lowering the measurement throughput.
