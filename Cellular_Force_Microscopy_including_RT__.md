##Limitations of the CFM approach
While the CFM has contributed significantly to uncovering the mechanics of single plant cells [RefHannesPlantJournal13, RefWeberJxpBot15], there are several technical limitations when they are applied to the investigation of pollen tube micromechanics. Substrate adhesion and localization of the pollen tubes is a major challenge for micro-indentation. While single cells that exhibit isotropic growth can be immobilized by surface patterning [RefSalapakaAFMYeastCells] or cappillary trapping, the rapid and three-dimensional nature of pollen tube growth prevents such immobilization techniques unusable.
