#Cellular Force Microscopy (including RT-CFM) and Atomic Force Microscopy

## CFM Introduction (Dimitris' and Kuhlemeier's Papers) ##

Mechanical measurements of plant cells and tissues imposes  various technical challenges. The assessment of different parameters, such as turgor pressure, cell wall stiffness or penetration forces, involve a wide range of forces from nanoNewtons to miliNewtons and requested a set of  several devices as discussed above. The topography of plant tissues makes it necessary to equip the force sensors with long probes and to have a wide z-positioning range to reach into the inclinations between turgid cells. A high degree of automation is important to create high-resolution stiffness maps and to measure a large number of samples. The cellular force microscope (CFM) combines the high level of automation and resolution as provided by AFM with the versatility of classic microindentation systems being able to measure in-plane elasticity, which is important to measure growth. The use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based force sensors allow to measure tissue regions that are difficult to reach with cantilever probes. Custom-made software allows the control of the positioner and reacts on sensor feedback.

First experiments using the CFM demonstrated that the method is suitable for high-resolution stiffness mapping on onion epidermal cells. A plasmolysed piece of tissue was measured sequentially over several hours during recovery from plasmolysis and revealed changes in topography and stiffness with increasing turgor pressure \cite{Routier-Kierzkowska2012a}.

Stiffness measurements taken under the conditions used by the CFM and other microindentation systems do not only reflect the mechanical properties of the cell wall alone but are strongly influenced by turgor pressure, cell and indenter geometry as well as stresses in the cell wall prior to indentation. Hence, the measured values are referred to as the "apparent stiffness" \cite{Zamir2004}. A finite element method-based modeling approach enables disentangling the effects of turgor pressure and cell wall stiffness. In addition to measuring the apparent stiffness it relies on the assessment of several geometrical parameters, such as the initial stretch ratio, which is correlated to the wall stress under pressure prior to indentation. This can be easily measured by comparing the diameter of a pollen tube before and after plasmolysis. Cell wall thickness is more difficult to measure. To get accurate values it is necessary to analyse electron microscopy images.

##CFM measurements on pollen tubes
First experiments on pollen tubes were performed by \cite{Vogler2013a}. CFM measurements on growing, fully turgid lily pollen tubes confirmed the apparent stiffness results from microindenter experiments with a soft apical region and gradually increasing stiffness that reached a plateau 20 Âµm behind the tip. FEM-based modeling was applied to extract the values for turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity by adjusting the material properties of the virtual cell wall until the modeled stiffness curve was in agreement with the measured values. Surprisingly, it was unnecessary to modify the elastic properties in the tip region to get an almost exact match, displaying a steep decrease in the apparent stiffness towards the very tip. This means, in other words, that the stiffness difference between the tip and the shank do not reflect the well-documented changes in cell wall composition but can be explained exclusively by the geometry of the cell and the contact angle between the probe tip and cell surface \cite{Vogler2013a, Routier-Kierzkowska2013a, Bolduc2006a}.

##Limitations of the CFM approach
While the CFM has contributed significantly to mechanical investigation of single plant cells \cite{Vogler_2012, Weber_2015}, a few experimental challenges still remain in high-throughput measurements of the micromechanics of growing pollen tubes. Firstly, ensuring sufficient substrate adhesion and localization of the fast-growing tip of the pollen tube is a major challenge for micro-indentation. While single cells, like yeasts or oocytes, that exhibit isotropic or near-isotropic growth can be immobilized by growing on solid growth medium [RefSalapakaAFMYeastCells], trapping in surface-patterned wells \cite{Ng_2007, Kailas_2009} or by capillary aspiration \cite{Yu_Sun_2003}, the rapid and three-dimensional nature of pollen tube growth renders such immobilization techniques unusable. Morever conventional _in vitro_ growth assays, lead to physical crossover and entanglement of tubes, which make it difficult to pre-plan the position and trajectory of the microindentor leading to reduction in measurement throughput.
