##Limitations of the CFM approach
While the CFM has contributed significantly to mechanical investigation of single plant cells [RefHannesPlantJournal13, RefWeberJxpBot15], there are a few added technical challenges in measuring the micromechanics of growing pollen tubes. Firstly, ensuring sufficient substrate adhesion and localization of fast-growing tip of the pollen tube is a major challenge for micro-indentation. While single cells like yeast or BY2 tobacco cells that exhibit isotropic growth can be immobilized by growing on solid growth medium [RefSalapakaAFMYeastCells], surface patterning [Ref]  or capillary trapping [Ref], the rapid and three-dimensional nature of pollen tube growth prevents such immobilization techniques unusable. Morever conventional _in vitro_ growth assays, lead to physical crossover and entanglement of tubes, which make it difficult to pre-plan the position and trajectory of the microindentor leading to reduction in measurement throughput.
