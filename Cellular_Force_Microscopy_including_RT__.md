##Limitations of the CFM approach
While the CFM has contributed significantly to uncovering the mechanics of single plant cells [RefHannesPlantJournal13, RefWeberJxpBot15], there are several technical limitations when applied to the  biomechanical investigation of pollen tube micromechanics. Firstly, substrate adhesion and localization of the pollen tubes is a major challenge for micro-indentation. While single cells like yeast or BY2 tobacco cells that exhibit isotropic growth can be immobilized by growing on solid growth medium [RefSalapakaAFMYeastCells], surface patterning [Ref]  or capillary trapping [Ref], the rapid and three-dimensional nature of pollen tube growth prevents such immobilization techniques unusable. Morever the in vitro growth of tubes, lead to entangled tubes, which make it difficult to pre-plan the position and trajectory of the microindentor.
