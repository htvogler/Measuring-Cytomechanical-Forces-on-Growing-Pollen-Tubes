#Conclusions and Further Developments
On its tortuous journey which begins from the stigma till the ovule, the pollen tube receives and processes a variety of chemical and mechanical cues from the surrounding environment. While the chemoattractants are perceived at a distance, the mechanical environment is only perceived when the tube is in physical contact with it. The counteracting mechanical forces generated by the tube in response to the chemo-mechanical signals from the outside, is feedback regulated in a complex feedback loop involving many of the cellâ€™s internal machinery. The generation and regulation of interal turgor turgor and the spatio-temporal variation of cell wall stiffness are manifestations of this feedback mechanism. Only in the last decade, with the arise of micromechanical probes and technology, have the mechanical forces generated by and on the tube been precisely quantified. Quantification of these mechanical parameters will lead to better models and insights into the growth and morphogenesis of pollen tubes.

High-throughput measurements are key to statistical evaluation of the mechanical properties of single cells. In addition to increasing the throughput of measurements and data analysis using hardware and software tools, what is quite important for measuring forces at these nano-newton to micro-newton ranges is calibration and traceability to force standards, so that mechanical data can be compared across laboratories.  Another technical challenge is the combination of intracellular physiological monitoring using fluorescent markers and mechanical probing to understand the interplay of biochemistry and mechanics. Several open questions remain in the mechanical morphogenesis of pollen tubes and there is the need for advanced instrumentation to answer them for the future. Reports of oscillating turgor have been made and this needs to be confirmed with precise pressure probe measurements. The exact network configuration of the biopolymers in the cell wall, along with TEM, atomic force microscopy might give clues to this biomolecular arrangement on the cell wall.
