##Measuring Turgor
Due to the lack of alternative methods turgor has been measured using the plasmolysis method. The osmolarity of the extracellular medium is increased until the retraction of the protoplast from the cell wall can be observed, allowing an estimation of the osmotic pressure inside the cell. This method is simple, non-invasive and allows a large number of measurements in a relatively short time. Living cells, however, tend to react to osmotic stress with osmoregulation, which means that the estimated osmolarity may differ from that in the unperturbed cell.

This problem can be overcome with the pressure probe, an oil-filled capillary equipped with a pressure transducer, which is inserted into the cell. Turgor is measured directly by adjusting the pressure in the probe in order to keep the cell sap/oil meniscus at the plasma membrane, such that no sap enters the probe and no oil enters the cell. Although, the pressure probe  is the only direct method to measure turgor until present, it has the disadvantage of being invasive and tedious to use, especially on small cells. This limits the number of measurements that can be taken in a day.

Ball tonometry is another method to estimate turgor. A cell is compressed with a large ball with a diameter between 30--50 Âµm. Since the cell wall is only a thin shell compared with the cell diameter, its influence can be neglected if the indentation is considerably larger. While this approach is fast and non-invasive, problems arise when the cell to be measured is small. Theoretically, it would be possible to miniaturize the setup but it is not quite clear to which extent the influence to cell wall elasticity would increase and could not be neglected anymore.
