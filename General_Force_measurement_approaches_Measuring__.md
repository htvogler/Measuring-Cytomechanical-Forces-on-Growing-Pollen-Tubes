##Measuring Turgor
Due to the lack of alternative methods turgor has been measured using the plasmolysis method \cite{deVries1884, Beck1929}. The osmolarity of the extracellular medium is increased until the retraction of the protoplast from the cell wall can be observed, allowing an estimation of the osmotic pressure inside the cell. This method is simple, non-invasive and allows a large number of measurements in a relatively short time. Living cells, however, tend to react to osmotic stress with osmoregulation, which means that the estimated osmolarity may differ from that in the unperturbed cell.

This problem can be overcome with the pressure probe, an oil-filled capillary equipped with a pressure transducer, which is inserted into the cell \cite{Green1968, Husken1978, Tomos1999}. Turgor is measured directly by adjusting the pressure in the probe in order to keep the cell sap/oil meniscus at the plasma membrane, such that no sap enters the probe and no oil enters the cell. Although, the pressure probe  is the only direct method to measure turgor until present, it has the disadvantage of being invasive and tedious to use, especially on small cells. This limits the number of measurements that can be taken in a day. Both methods, incipient plasmolysis and the pressure probe have been applied to estimate turgor pressure in growing lily (*Lilium longiflorum*) pollen tubes, delivering significantly different results \cite{Benkert1997}. ((Another paper - Measurement of turgor in lily pollen grains \cite{Pertl_2010}))


Ball tonometry is another method to estimate turgor. A cell is compressed with a large ball with a diameter between 30--50 µm. Since the cell wall is only a thin shell compared with the cell diameter, its influence can be neglected if the indentation is considerably larger \cite{Lintilhac2000, Wei2001}. While this approach is fast and non-invasive, problems arise when the cell to be measured is small. Theoretically, it would be possible to miniaturize the setup but it is not quite clear to which extent the influence to cell wall elasticity would increase and could not be neglected anymore.

##Indentation methods
Plant cell walls are complex composite materials consisting of cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectins and proteins. It is still under debate how exactly the individual components interact together to define the mechanical characteristics of the cell wall \cite{Cosgrove2016}. It is generally accepted, however, that the cellulose microfibrils are the load-bearing component, which are embedded in a more viscous pectin matrix. Hemicelluloses may be directly crosslinked to individual cellulose microfibrils and thus tether them together \cite{Hayashi_1989, Pauly1999a, Scheller2010}, or they may be covalently bound to the pectin network and connect individual cellulose microfibrils where they come close together in so-called biomechanical hotspots \cite{Park2012, Zhao2014a, Nili2015}. In pollen tube cell walls the cellulose content is considerably lower than in other plant cells \cite{Rae_1985, Schlupmann1994}. Although they are lacking a classic secondary cell wall, pollen tubes of many species display a bi-layered cell wall with an outer layer dominated by pectins and an inner callose layer. In addition to this radial patterning the cell wall changes its biochemical composition along the longitudinal axis with a tip-region that consists mainly of methylated pectins. Through the action of pectin methyl esterases pectins get demethylated and consequently cross linked by Ca²⁺ in the sub apical region together with the appearance of crystalline cellulose. Further up the shank the deposition of callose can be observed \citep[reviewed in ][]{Mollet2013}.

To understand the mechanical control of pollen tube tip-growth, as well as shape-keeping it is necessary to measure the physical properties of the cell wall along the pollen tube axis. Different approaches have been tried to assess the mechanical properties of tip-growing cells. In order to be able to see local differences in cell wall properties, it is essential that the chosen method provides highly resolved positional data and must cover the proper force range, which is in the microNewtons for plant cell walls. As the thickness of the cell wall is usually much smaller than the cell diameter, indentation methods have proven valuable to determine the mechanical properties of the cell wall.

What information results form indentation experiments depends on the  indentation depth as well as on the geometry and the size of the indenter. An indentation depth much smaller than the thickness of the cell wall mainly reveals the mechanical properties of the cell wall while at higher indentation depths the influence of turgor pressure increases. Equally, the influence of turgor decreases with decreasing indenter diameter. Taken together, a rather big indenter at low indentation depth would reveal in plane stresses of the cell wall, while a pointy probe, as they are frequently used in atomic force microscopy, would measure forces perpendicular to the plane of the wall.

For quite a while atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to picture the topography of plant cells \citep[reviewed in ]{Yarbrough2009}. However, the AFM can also be used to evaluate the mechanical properties of cells. After the use of the AFM as a material indenter has been proven useful in bacterial and animal cells, first attempts in plant cells included the study of the nano-mechanical properties of dead wood cells \cite{Clair_2003} and cultured cells of *Vitis vinifera* \cite{Lesniewska2004}. Recently, after a further improvement of the technology, further studies started to assess the mechanical properties of living and growing tissues by probing the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of *Arabidopsis*. Using a sharp, pyramidal inventor and indentation depths significantly smaller than the estimated cell wall thickness, which rendered the measurements insensitive to turgor pressure, Milani and collegues could show that the cells at the top of the SAM are stiffer than those at the flank \cite{Milani2011a}. Glueing large spheres to the AFM probe makes the measurements highly sensitive to turgor \cite{Peaucelle2011a}. Other studies were investigating the material properties of the cell wall in *Arabidopsis* culture cells \cite{Radotic2012} or the material plasticity along the *Arabidopsis* root \cite{Fernandes2012}. Although AFM would be an attractive method to investigate the nano-mechanical properties of pollen tube cell walls, no such studies have been published yet, probably because of technical difficulties due to small cell diameter and fast growth. That it is possible to look at pollen tubes by AFM has been shown by Wu and colleagues, who compare the topography of the apical and sub apical regions of *Torenia fournieri* pollen tubes \cite{Wu2008}.

Although modern AFM setups provide a larger range of forces (nanoNewtons to microNewtons) and measuring area, their strength lies in the measurement of very local nano-mechanical properties in the dimension of the indentation axis. To quantify the in-plane elasticity, which is influenced by the load bearing cellulose microfibrils, however, larger indentation depths are necessary. Hence, a lot of effort was invested to develop microindentation systems that combine the ability to non-invasively map the mechanical properties of living and growing cells with large indentation depths and force ranges. 

Pioneering work was done by Anja Geitmann and co-workers. Using a microindentation approach they could show that poppy (*Papaver rhoeas*) pollen tubes show a gradient of cellular stiffness along the tube axis with a soft tip and a harder shank. Moreover, the shank was almost completely elastic whereas the apical region displayed considerable viscoelasticity \cite{Geitmann2004a}. Later, the stiffness gradient from the apex to the shank was confirmed in pollen tubes of lily. Additional experiments revealed that the cellular stiffness inn the apical region followed growth oscillations with increased stiffness at high growth rates and vice versa \cite{Zerzour2009} . Taken together, these findings fitted well with the fact that the pollen tube apex, where growth takes place after all, should be softer than the shank, which does not expand but has to resist tension forces created by turgor pressure. Differences in the biochemical composition of the cell wall in the tip region compared to the shank could explain the observed mechanical difference. Indeed it has been shown in pollen tubes of *Solanum chacoense* that reduced levels of both pectins and callose lead to a measurable reduction in cellular stiffness and increased viscoelasticity \cite{Parre2005, Parre2005a}. However, the above studies don't take into account the influence of turgor pressure and the geometry of the pollen tube as we will discuss in the next chapter.
