#Improvements

Several improvements have been proposed for increasing the throughput of micro-indentation.

##Micro-channels
Uni-directional guidance and improvements in cellular adhesion, for large micromechanical data collection

##Computer vision
Tracking the tip

##2-axis sensors
For possible deconvolution of geometry and biochemical difference. 
For penetration force tests (Should we give out this idea?)
