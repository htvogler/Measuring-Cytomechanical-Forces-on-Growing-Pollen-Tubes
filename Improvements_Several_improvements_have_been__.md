#Improvements

Several improvements have been proposed to overcome the aforementioned challenges to increasing the throughput of micro-indentation. The increased efficiency of quantitative data collection will enable generation of statistical micromechanical datasets for deciphering the complex chemo-mechanical process of fast tip growth in pollen tubes. 

##Micro-channels
Microfluidics technology has evolved into a powerful tool to isolate and chemo-mechanically probe individual cells \cite{Nilsson_2009}. It has been recently applied to investigate polarized cell growth in neuronal axons, filamentous fungal hyphae and in pollen tubes, by isolating the tip-growing region from the rest of the cell body \cite{Taylor_2005, Geng_2015, Agudelo_2013}. Recently we demonstrated the use of a microfluidic platform to uni-directionally guide, parallelly close-pack with vertical and lateral confinement of the growth of individual tubes. In addition, to enabling long-term growth observations, the microchannel confinment resulted in the tubes emerging straight out of the channels without deviations in growth directions which enable faster tip positioning and measurement . Additionally, the vertically confined growth in the microchannels increased the cellular adhesion to the substrate enhancing the robustness of micro-indentation.

##Computer vision
Fluorescent multi-pollen trajector tracker \cite{Cheung_2013} 
This is a post-processing technique and does not allow for real-time pollen tube tip tracking and microindentor positioning.

##2-axis sensors
For possible deconvolution of geometry and biochemical difference. 
For penetration force tests (Should we give out this idea?)
