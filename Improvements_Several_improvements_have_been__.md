#Improvements

Several improvements have been proposed to overcome the aforementioned challenges to increasing the throughput of micro-indentation. The increased efficiency of quantitative data collection will enable generation of statistical micromechanical datasets for deciphering the complex chemo-mechanical process of fast tip growth in pollen tubes. 

##Micro-channels
Microfluidic technology has evolved into a powerful tool to monitor and control the microenvironment around single cells. It has been recently applied to investigate polarizes growth in neuronal axons and in filamentous fungal hyphae, by isolating the tip-growing region from the rest of the cell body \cite{Taylor_2005, Geng_2015}. We demonstrate the use of a microfluidic platform to guide, parallelly close-pack vertically and laterally the growth of individual tubes and enable increased cellular adhesion and stability of micro-indentation. Morever the increased predictability of growth direction after emerging out of the microchannels allow for faster tip positioning and measurement.

##Computer vision
Fluorescent multi-pollen trajector tracker \cite{Cheung_2013} 
This is a post-processing technique and does not allow for real-time pollen tube tip tracking and microindentor positioning.

(2) Visual Servoing using millimeter-range DC motor driven stages. 
(3) Image Stitching

##2-axis sensors
For possible deconvolution of geometry and biochemical difference. 
For penetration force tests (Should we give out this idea?)
