#Improvements

Several improvements have been proposed for increasing the throughput of micro-indentation.

##Micro-channels
Uni-directional guidance and improvements in cellular adhesion, for large micromechanical data collection
EMBC proceedings citation and (submitted manuscript JExpBot)

##Computer vision
Fluorescent multi-pollen trajector tracker \cite{Cheung_2013} 
This is a post-processing technique and does not allow for real-time pollen tube tip tracking and microindentor positioning. 
\cite{Felekis_2015}

(1) Tracking the tip
(2) Visual Servoing using millimeter-range DC motor driven stages. 
(3) Image Stitching

##2-axis sensors
For possible deconvolution of geometry and biochemical difference. 
For penetration force tests (Should we give out this idea?)
