#Improvements

Several improvements have been proposed to overcome the aforementioned challenges to increasing the throughput of micro-indentation. The increased data collection efficiency will enable generation of statistical micromechanical datasets to overcome the inherent biological heterogeneity within a cell population for deciphering the complex chemo-mechanical process of fast tip growth in pollen tubes. 

##Microchannel Guidance
Microfluidics has emerged as a powerful technology platform to isolate and chemo-mechanically probe individual cells \cite{Nilsson_2009}. Cytomechanical studies typically involve optical monitoring of cellular deformation subject to external forcing (for eg., by fluid-driven cell loading onto narrow constrictions \cite{Di_Carlo_2012} or by electro-deformation with time-varying nonuniform electric fields \cite{Engelhardt_1988}). High throughput micromechanical assays can be achieved using 2D array of mechanoprobes \cite{Sniadecki_2007, Favre_2011}. While typical micron-sized single cells like osteocytes can be mechanically probed using above mentioned techniques and possibly scaled for high-throughput, this is difficult to achieveve for mechanical measurements of pollen tubes as their cell body can extend over several millimeters and with geometric aspect ratios of 10,000:1  or more. Recently, polarized cell growth investigations have been performed, aided by microfluidic channels, in neuronal axons, in filamentous fungal hyphae and in pollen tubes, by isolating the tip-growing region from the rest of the cell body \cite{Taylor_2005, Geng_2015, Agudelo_2013}.  Another problem arising with typical calibration of microdevices is force calibration, as the deformation of on-chip flexible materials is nonlinear and variable and need external calibration. While it is possible to read, the interaction mechanics of two similarly stiff structures are harder to model. So we went for the architecture of a stiff indentor. Another problem is no direct force readout. You need model-based force-readouts which introduce errors. 

Recently we demonstrated the use of a microfluidic platform that  allows for the germination, growth and uni-directional guidance of individual pollen tubes \cite{Shamsudhin2016}. This Lab-on-a-Chip is readily integrated with the CFM for mechanical measurements on the pollen tubes. The chip with parallelly close-packs with vertical and lateral confinement of the growth of individual tubes. In addition, to enabling long-term growth observations, the microchannel confinment resulted in the tubes emerging straight out of the channels without deviations in growth directions which enable faster tip positioning and measurement . Additionally, the vertically confined growth in the microchannels increased the cellular adhesion to the substrate enhancing the robustness of micro-indentation.
