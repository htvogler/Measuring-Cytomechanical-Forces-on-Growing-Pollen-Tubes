#Improvements

Several improvements have been proposed to overcome the aforementioned challenges to increasing the throughput of micro-indentation. The increased data collection efficiency will enable generation of statistically relevant micromechanical datasets to overcome the inherent biological heterogeneity within a cell population for deciphering the complex chemo-mechanical processes involved in the fast tip growth in pollen tubes. 

##Microchannel Guidance
Microfluidics has emerged as a powerful technology platform to isolate and chemo-mechanically probe individual cells \cite{Nilsson_2009}. Cytomechanical studies typically involve optical monitoring of cellular deformation subject to external forcing (for eg., by fluid-driven cell loading onto narrow constrictions \cite{Di_Carlo_2012}, by electro-deformation with non-uniform electric fields \cite{Engelhardt_1988}, etc). Such on-chip technology can also produce high-throughput micromechanical assays using patterned 2D array of mechanoprobes \cite{Sniadecki_2007, Favre_2011}. While the typical micron-sized single cells, like erythrocytes and 3T3 cells, can now be mechanically probed using above mentioned techniques and possibly scaled for high-throughput, similar techniques are difficult to achieve for mechanical measurements of pollen tubes as their cell body can extend over several millimeters and with geometric aspect ratios of 10,000:1  or more. Another problem arising with typical calibration of microdevices is force calibration, as the deformation of on-chip flexible materials is nonlinear and variable and need external calibration and can exhibit hysteresis. While it is possible to read, the interaction mechanics of two similarly stiff structures are harder to model. So we went for the architecture of a stiff indentor. Another problem is no direct force readout. You need model-based force-readouts which introduce errors. Recently, polarized cell growth investigations have been performed, aided by growth in microfluidic channels, in neuronal axons, in filamentous fungal hyphae and in pollen tubes, by isolating the tip-growing region from the rest of the cell body \cite{Taylor_2005, Geng_2015, Agudelo_2013}.  

To increase the measurement efficacy of the CFM micromechanical assay, we recently demonstrated the use of an integrated microfluidic-CFM platform that  allows for high-throughput germination, growth and uni-directional guidance, and micromechnical measurements of individual pollen tubes \cite{Shamsudhin2016}. The chip with parallelly close-packs with vertical and lateral confinement of the growth of individual tubes. In addition, to enabling long-term growth observations, the microchannel confinment resulted in the tubes emerging straight out of the channels without deviations in growth directions which enable faster tip positioning and measurement. Additionally, the vertically confined growth in the microchannels increased the cellular adhesion to the substrate enhancing the robustness of micro-indentation. 

##Real-time Computer Vision
Fluorescent multi-pollen trajector tracker \cite{Cheung_2013} 
This is a post-processing technique and does not allow for real-time pollen tube tip tracking and microindentor positioning.

For possible deconvolution of geometry and biochemical difference. 
For penetration force tests (Should we give out this idea?)
