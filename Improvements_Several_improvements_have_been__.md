#Improvements

Several improvements have been proposed to overcome the aforementioned challenges to increasing the throughput of micro-indentation. The increased efficiency of quantitative data collection will enable generation of statistical micromechanical datasets for deciphering the complex chemo-mechanical process of fast tip growth in pollen tubes. 

##Microchannel Guidance
Microfluidics technology has evolved into a powerful tool to isolate and chemo-mechanically probe individual cells \cite{Nilsson_2009}. It has been recently applied to investigate polarized cell growth in neuronal axons, filamentous fungal hyphae and in pollen tubes, by isolating the tip-growing region from the rest of the cell body \cite{Taylor_2005, Geng_2015, Agudelo_2013}. Mechanical measurements on microfluidic devices... While typical micron-sized single cells like osteocytes can be mechanically probed using passive constrictions, pollen tubes show a difficulty as their cell body can extend over several millimeters and with geometric aspect ratios of 10,000:1 are more. problems with calibration of high-throughput devices. While it is possible to read, the interaction mechanics of two similarly stiff structures are harder to model. So we went for the architecture of a stiff indentor. 

Recently we demonstrated the use of a microfluidic platform that  allows for the germination, growth and uni-directional guidance of individual pollen tubes \cite{Shamsudhin2016}. This Lab-on-a-Chip is readily integrated with the CFM for mechanical measurements on the pollen tubes. The chip with parallelly close-packs with vertical and lateral confinement of the growth of individual tubes. In addition, to enabling long-term growth observations, the microchannel confinment resulted in the tubes emerging straight out of the channels without deviations in growth directions which enable faster tip positioning and measurement . Additionally, the vertically confined growth in the microchannels increased the cellular adhesion to the substrate enhancing the robustness of micro-indentation.

##Real-time Computer Vision
Fluorescent multi-pollen trajector tracker \cite{Cheung_2013} 
This is a post-processing technique and does not allow for real-time pollen tube tip tracking and microindentor positioning.

##2-axis Force Sensors
For possible deconvolution of geometry and biochemical difference. 
For penetration force tests (Should we give out this idea?)
