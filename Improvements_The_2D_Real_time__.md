#Improvements--The 2D Real-time CFM

Several improvements have been proposed to overcome the aforementioned challenges to increase the throughput of micro-indentation. The resulting higher efficiency in data collection will enable the generation of micromechanical datasets that are amenable to statistical analysis. Such datasets are essential to overcome the inherent biological heterogeneity within a population to decipher the underlying complex biochemical and cytomechanical processes controlling the fast tip growth of pollen tubes. 

##Microchannel Guidance
Microfluidics has emerged as a powerful technology to isolate and chemically as well as mechanically probe individual cells \cite{Nilsson_2009}. Such cytomechanical studies typically involve optical monitoring of the cellular deformation caused by to externally applied on-chip forces, e.g. by fluid-driven cell loading onto narrow constrictions \cite{Di_Carlo_2012}, or by electro-deformation with non-uniform electric fields \cite{Engelhardt_1988}, etc). High-throughput micromechanical assays have also been performed using a patterned two-dimensional array of mechanoprobes \cite{Sniadecki_2007,Favre_2011}. While a typical µm-sized animal cell, such as an erythrocyte or 3T3 cell, can be mechanically probed using the above-mentioned techniques, it is difficult to apply such immobilization and force measurement methods to pollen tubes because they grow fast and are extremely elongate. Another problem that arises when using single or multiple on-chip  force actuators, is the difficulty in force calibration at the nN to mN scale typical for cellular forces \cite{Kim_2011}. Furthermore, the use of flexible materials, such as PDMS that is commonly used in microfluidics approaches, or the use of magnetic or piezoelectric materials as actuators, can result in actuator hysteresis and nonlinear responses. This behavior can compromise quantitative cytomechanical assays by convoluting them with the actual mechanical response of the cell. The need for well-calibrated mechanical assays incorporating microfludic technologies is paramount. 

Recently, microfluidic phenotyping assays have been developed for cells exhibiting polarized growth such as neuronal axons, filamentous fungal hyphae and pollen tubes \cite{Taylor_2005,Geng_2015,Agudelo_2013}. The reported Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) devices used microchannels to guide the tip-growing compartments by isolating them from the rest of the cell body. To increase the measurement efficacy of the CFM-based micromechanical assays, we developed an integrated microfluidic-CFM platform that allows for high-throughput germination, growth, and uni-directional guidance, combined with micromechanical measurements of individual pollen tubes \cite{Shamsudhin2016}. The LoC has a loading and germination reservoir for the pollen grains, which is surrounded by dozens of collinear microchannels \ref{fig:channels}a. These channels guide the growing pollen tubes uni-directionally, with vertical and lateral confinements, enabling long-term observations without the need for active z-focusing on the microscope \ref{fig:channels}b. The LoC has an open architecture, which allows it to be integrated with the CFM microindentor probe \ref{fig:channels}c. After growing in the microchannels, the pollen tubes exit the LoC and grow onto the open glass slide, being fully immersed in the growth medium. After, emerging from the microchannels, the pollen tubes grow straight for several hundred μm without deviations from their previous growth direction. This allows for a faster positioning of the CFM force sensor on the growing pollen tubes, thus increasing measurement throughput. Additionally, the vertically confined growth in the microchannels increases the adhesion of the pollen tube to the substrate, enhancing the robustness of microindentation. 

The micro-indentation measurements on the integrated microfluidic-CFM system confirmed the previously reported gradient in apparent stiffness along the axis of the pollen tube. The measurements identified two different states of apparent stiffness, corresponding to growing and non-growing (naturally growth-arrested) pollen tubes. While growing tubes exhibited a mean loading stiffness of 2.20 N/m, non-growing tubes exhibited 0.69 N/m. It is well known that the apparent stiffness is affected by the turgor pressure of the cell when forces are in the range of μN and indentation depths applied by the CFM probe in the range of μm \cite{Weber_2015}. While it is reasonable to assume that non-growing pollen tubes may have lower turgor pressures \cite{Geitmann_2004}, states of modified cell wall biochemistry cannot be ruled out, as pressure-probe measurements on lily pollen tubes have not found a correlation between growth rates and turgor pressure \cite{Benkert_1997}. 

##Real-time Computer Vision
In optical and mechanical phenotyping assays, the ability to monitor individual pollen tube growth trajectories is crucial. The naturally three-dimensional and disordered growth of pollen tubes increases the time and complexity of optical measurements, as the operator has to constantly refocus in the z-plane to keep the tube in focus for long-term measurements. Additionally, the entangled growth pollen tubes makes it difficult to distinguish one pollen tube from the other. Currently, pollen tube identification is mostly done manually, but a software algorithm called fluorescent multi-pollen trajectory tracker was implemented by Palanivelu’s group as part of the Bioinformatics Toolset of the Pollen Research Coordination Network  \cite{Cheung_2013}. However, this is primarily a tool for data post-processing and cannot identify the pollen tube’s trajectory in real-time. We developed a robotic platform, which utilizes computer vision, for real-time tracking of pollen tubes and for controlling the micro-indentor probe \cite{Felekis_2015}. In addition, the real-time system allows for image mosaicing, which creates high-resolution images of a large workspace to accomodate pollen tubes that are several mm in length. This mosaic stitching is made possible by a fixed camera-lens system and a movable sample holder mounted on a dual-stage mm range positioner. For more details on the hardware and software algorithm, the reader is referred to \cite{Felekis_2015}.

##Dual-axis Force Sensors

The gradient of apparent stiffness measured along the pollen tube’s length, with a softer apical region, has been attributed to a biochemical gradient in the cell wall \cite{Geitmann_2004a,Chebli_2012}, an effect of geometry and non-normal surface indentation \cite{Vogler_2012} or a convolution of both the previously mentioned effects \cite{Shamsudhin2016,Shamsudhin2016a}. The use of multi-axis force sensors may allow the deconvolution of these two effects. The design, fabrication and calibration of multi-axis µN force sensors have been reported in the literature \cite{Beyeler_2009,Muntwyler_2009}. We highlight preliminary results of micro-indentation performed on lily pollen tubes with a dual-axis force sensor \cite{Burri2016a}. The sensor converts the axial and lateral force at the probe tip to an independent change in deflection of orthogonal comb drives \ref{fig:2Dsensor}. The comb drives convert the displacement change to a differential change in capacitance, which can be read out using on-board electronics. During vertical indentation of the pollen tube, both vertical and lateral forces are simultaneously detected at the very apex of the pollen tube and the subapical region. No measurable lateral forces were observed beyond 4 μm from the apex. The measurement of lateral forces at the pollen tube tip is an indication of a non-normal contact angle. These promising results on the use of dual-axis force sensors for micro-indentation experiments are currently being pursued further.
