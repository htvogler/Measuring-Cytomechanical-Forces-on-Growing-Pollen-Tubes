Cytomechanical measurements are important to unravel the influence of the biochemical composition of the plant cell wall on growth, morphogenesis and stability of the entire plant. The profitability of whole branches of industry depends on plants, which ideally grow as fast and large as possible without loosing the strength to withstand destabilizing environmental factors. Pollen tubes provide a convenient system to study major aspects of cytomechanics. They grow extremely fast but expansion is restricted to the tip region, which allows studying the mechanical properties as the cell wall is modified at the apex and compare them with the final cell wall in the shank of the same cell. The way of the pollen tube from the stigma to the ovule is full of obstacles in the form of cells from the female tissue. Once an obstruction is sensed, it can be either skirted or penetrated, which involves mechanosensing, signal translation into physiological changes and the adaptation of the mechanical properties of the pollen tube. As a result, the pollen tube changes its growth direction or increases the pushing force, both of which are controlled by a fine-tuned interplay between turgor pressure and cell wall extensibility. In this chapter, we give an overview of the state-of-the art methods to measure those two parameters, as well as an outlook towards novel technical developments that will allow the precise evaluation of the mechanical properties of the cell wall along the pollen tube axis.
