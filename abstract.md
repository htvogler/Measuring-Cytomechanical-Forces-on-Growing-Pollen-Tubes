Cytomechanical measurements are important to unravel the influence of the biochemical composition of the plant cell wall on growth, morphogenesis and stability of the entire plant. The profitability of whole branches of industry depends on plants, which ideally grow as fast and large as possible without loosing the strength to withstand destabilizing environmental factors. Pollen tubes provide a convenient system to study major aspects of cytomechanics. They grow extremely fast but expansion is restricted to the tip region, which allows to study mechanical properties as the cell wall is modified at the apex and compare them with the final cell wall in the shank of the same cell. Expansive growth of plant cells is controlled by a fine-tuned interplay between turgor pressure and cell wall extensibility.
