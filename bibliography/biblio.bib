@article{Green1968,
  abstract = {THE VIEW THAT THE PLANT CELL GROWS BY THE YIELDING OF THE CELL WALL TO TURGOR PRESSURE CAN BE EXPRESSED IN THE EQUATION: rate = cell extensibility x turgor. All growth rate responses can in principle be resolved into changes in the 2 latter variables. Extensibility will relate primarily to the yielding properties of the cell wall, turgor primarily to solute uptake or production. Use of this simple relationship in vivo requires that at least 2 of the 3 variables be measured in a growing cell. Extensibility is not amenable to direct measurement. Data on rate and turgor for single Nitella cells can, however, be continuously gathered to permit calculation of extensibility (rate/turgor). Rate is accurately obtained from measurements on time-lapse film. Turgor is estimated in the same cell, to within 0.1 atm or less, by measurement of the ability of the cell to compress gas trapped in the closed end of a capillary the open end of which is in the cell vacuole. The method is independent of osmotic equilibrium. It operates continuously for several days, over a several fold increase in cell length, and has response time of less than one minute. Rapid changes in turgor brought on by changes in tonicity of the medium, show that extensibility, as defined above, is not constant but has a value of zero unless the cell has about 80\% of normal turgor. Because elastic changes are small, extensibility relates to growth. Over long periods of treatment in a variety of osmotica the threshold value for extensibility and growth is seen to fall to lower values to permit resumption of growth at reduced turgor. A brief period of rapid growth (5x normal) follows the return to normal turgor. All variables then become normal and the cycle can be repeated. The cell remains essentially at osmotic equilibrium, even while growing at 5x the normal rate. The method has potential for detailed in vivo analyses of ``wall softening.''},

  abstract = {A new method is described for continuously measuring cell turgor pressure (P), hydraulic conductivity (L(p)), and volumetric elastic modulus (epsilon) in higher plant cells, using a pressure probe. This technique permits volume changes, DeltaV, and turgor pressure changes, DeltaP, to be determined with an accuracy of 10(-5) to 10(-6) mul and 3 to 5.10(-2) bar, respectively.The main principle of the new method is the same as the pressure probe developed by Zimmermann and Steudle in which pressure is transmitted to a pressure transducer by means of an oil-filled capillary introduced into the cell. In order to use the pressure probe for small tissue cells, the effective compressible volume of the apparatus has to be sufficiently small in comparison to the volume of the cell itself. This is achieved by accurately fixing the oil/cell sap boundary in the very tip of the microcapillary by means of an electronic feedback mechanism, so that the effective volume of the apparatus is reduced to about 2 to 10\% of the cell volume. In this way also, errors arising from compressibility of the apparatus and temperature fluctuations can be excluded.Measurements on tissues cells of Capsicum annuum fruits yield epsilon values of 2 to 25 bar. Furthermore, epsilon can be shown to be a function of both cell turgor pressure and cell volume; epsilon increases with increasing turgor pressure and is higher in larger cells.},

Together with a suite of microanalytical techniques it has permitted the mapping of water and solute relations at the resolution of single cells and has the potential to link quantitatively the traditionally separate areas of water relations and metabolism. The development of the probe is outlined and its modification to measure root pressure and xylem tension described. The deployment of the pressure probe to determine and map turgor, hydraulic conductivity, reflection coefficient, cell rheological properties, solute concentrations and enzyme activities at the resolution of single cells is discussed. The controversy surrounding the interpretation of results obtained with the xylem-pressure probe is included. Possible further developments of the probe and applications of single cell sampling are suggested.},

  abstract = {The turgor pressure of growing pollen tubes of the lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) has been recorded using a turgor pressure probe. Insertion of the probe's micropipette was routinely accomplished, providing recording periods of 20 to 30 min. Probe insertion did not affect tube growth. The stable turgor values ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 MPa, the mean value being 0.209 +/- 0.064 MPa (n = 106). A brief increase in turgor, generated by injection of oil through the pressure probe, caused the tube to burst at its tip. Burst pressures ranged between 0.19 and 0.58 MPa, that is, individual lily pollen tubes do not withstand turgor pressure approaching twice their regular turgor pressure. In contrast, parallel experiments using the incipient plasmolysis technique yielded a mean putative turgor pressure of 0.79 MPa either using sucrose (n = 24) or mannitol (n = 25). Surprisingly, turgor pressure was not significantly correlated with tube growth rate which ranged from zero to 13 mu m/min. Nor did it correlate with tube length over the tested range of 100 to 1600 mu m In addition the influence of the medium's osmolality was surprisingly low: raising the external osmotic pressure from 0.36 to 1.08 MPa, with sucrose or mannitol, only caused mean turgor pressure to decline from 0.27 to 0.18 MPa. We conclude that growing lily pollen regulates its turgor pressure remarkably well despite substantial variation in tube growth rate, tube length, and osmotic milieu.},

  abstract = {In this article we describe a new method for the determination of turgor pressures in living plant cells. Based on the treatment of growing plant cells as thin-walled pressure vessels, we find that pressures can be accurately determined by observing and measuring the area of the contact patch formed when a spherical glass probe is lowered onto the cell surface with a known force. Within the limits we have described, we can show that the load (determined by precalibration of the device) divided by the projected area of the contact patch (determined by video microscopy) provides a direct, rapid, and accurate measure of the internal turgor pressure of the cell. We demonstrate, by parallel measurements with the pressure probe, that our method yields pressure data that are consistent with those from the pressure probe. Also, by incubating target tissues in stepped concentrations of mannitol to incrementally reduce the turgor pressure we show that the pressures measured by tonometry accurately reflect the predicted changes from the osmotic potential of the bathing medium. The advantages of this new method over the pressure probe are considerable, however, in that we can move rapidly from cell to cell, taking measurements every 20 s. In addition, the nondestructive nature of the method means that we can return to the same cell repeatedly for periodic pressure measurements. The limitations of the method lie in the fact that it is suitable only for superficial cells that: are directly accessible to the probe and to cells that are relatively thin walled and not heavily decorated with surface features. It is also not suitable for measuring pressures in flaccid cells.},

To determine the effects of cell elasticity and turgor pressure on the cell's ability to bear load, we loaded a small glass ball onto a cell and measured the projected contact area between the ball and the cell. Unlike previous studies, we considered the cell as a whole entity, and utilized the Boussinesq's solution to derive the relevant equations that related the elastic parameters and cell deformation. For cells with a turgor pressure greater than or equal to 0.34 MPa, the predicted contact area agreed well with the measured area. The equations could also predict cell turgor pressure with a deviation from the measured value of 0.01 MPa. This study gives strong support to ball tonometry, a new method of measuring cell turgor pressure.},

@article{Park2012,
  abstract = {Xyloglucan is widely believed to function as a tether between cellulose microfibrils in the primary cell wall, limiting cell enlargement by restricting the ability of microfibrils to separate laterally. To test the biomechanical predictions of this ``tethered network'' model, we assessed the ability of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) hypocotyl walls to undergo creep (long-term, irreversible extension) in response to three family-12 endo-beta-1,4-glucanases that can specifically hydrolyze xyloglucan, cellulose, or both. Xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase (XEG from Aspergillus aculeatus) failed to induce cell wall creep, whereas an endoglucanase that hydrolyzes both xyloglucan and cellulose (Cel12A from Hypocrea jecorina) induced a high creep rate. A cellulose-specific endoglucanase (CEG from Aspergillus niger) did not cause cell wall creep, either by itself or in combination with XEG. Tests with additional enzymes, including a family-5 endoglucanase, confirmed the conclusion that to cause creep, endoglucanases must cut both xyloglucan and cellulose. Similar results were obtained with measurements of elastic and plastic compliance. Both XEG and Cel12A hydrolyzed xyloglucan in intact walls, but Cel12A could hydrolyze a minor xyloglucan compartment recalcitrant to XEG digestion. Xyloglucan involvement in these enzyme responses was confirmed by experiments with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hypocotyls, where Cel12A induced creep in wild-type but not in xyloglucan-deficient (xxt1/xxt2) walls. Our results are incompatible with the common depiction of xyloglucan as a load-bearing tether spanning the 20- to 40-nm spacing between cellulose microfibrils, but they do implicate a minor xyloglucan component in wall mechanics. The structurally important xyloglucan may be located in limited regions of tight contact between microfibrils.},

  abstract = {Cellulose and xyloglucan (XG) assemble to form the cellulose/XG network, which is considered to be the dominant load-bearing structure in the growing cell walls of non-graminaceous land plants. We have extended the most commonly accepted model for the macromolecular organization of XG in this network, based on the structural and quantitative analysis of three distinct XG fractions that can be differentially extracted from the cell walls isolated from etiolated pea stems. Approximately 8\% of the dry weight of these cell walls consists of XG that can be solubilized by treatment of the walls with a XG-specific endoglucanase (XEG). This material corresponds to an enzyme-susceptible XG domain, proposed to form the cross-links between cellulose microfibrils. Another 10\% of the cell wall consists of XG that can be solubilized by concentrated KOH after XEG treatment. This material constitutes another XG domain, proposed to be closely associated with the surface of the cellulose microfibrils. An additional 3\% of the cell wall consists of XG that can be solubilized only when the XEG- and KOH-treated cell walls are treated with cellulase. This material constitutes a third XG domain, proposed to be entrapped within or between cellulose microfibrils. Analysis of the three fractions indicates that metabolism is essentially limited to the enzyme-susceptible domain. These results support the hypothesis that enzyme-catalyzed modification of XG cross-links in the cellulose/XG network is required for the growth and development of the primary plant cell wall, and demonstrate that the structural consequences of these metabolic events can be analyzed in detail.},

  abstract = {Hemicelluloses are polysaccharides in plant cell walls that have beta-(1-->4)-linked backbones with an equatorial configuration. Hemicelluloses include xyloglucans, xylans, mannans and glucomannans, and beta-(1-->3,1-->4)-glucans. These types of hemicelluloses are present in the cell walls of all terrestrial plants, except for beta-(1-->3,1-->4)-glucans, which are restricted to Poales and a few other groups. The detailed structure of the hemicelluloses and their abundance vary widely between different species and cell types. The most important biological role of hemicelluloses is their contribution to strengthening the cell wall by interaction with cellulose, and, in some walls, with lignin. These features are discussed in relation to widely accepted models of the primary wall. Hemicelluloses are synthesized by glycosyltransferases located in the Golgi membranes. Many glycosyltransferases needed for biosynthesis of xyloglucans and mannans are known. In contrast, the biosynthesis of xylans and beta-(1-->3,1-->4)-glucans remains very elusive, and recent studies have led to more questions than answers.

  abstract = {The advent of user-friendly instruments for measuring force/deflection curves of plant surfaces at high spatial resolution has resulted in a recent outpouring of reports of the ‘Young’s modulus’ of plant cell walls. The stimulus for these mechanical measurements comes from biomechanical models of morphogenesis of meristems and other tissues, as well as single cells, in which cell wall stress feeds back to regulate microtubule organization, auxin transport, cellulose deposition, and future growth directionality. In this article I review the differences between elastic modulus and wall extensibility in the context of cell growth. Some of the inherent complexities, assumptions, and potential pitfalls in the interpretation of indentation force/deflection curves are discussed. Reported values of elastic moduli from surface indentation measurements appear to be 10- to >1000-fold smaller than realistic tensile elastic moduli in the plane of plant cell walls. Potential reasons for this disparity are discussed, but further work is needed to make sense of the huge range in reported values. The significance of wall stress relaxation for growth is reviewed and connected to recent advances and remaining enigmas in our concepts of how cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectins are assembled to make an extensible cell wall. A comparison of the loosening action of α-expansin and Cel12A endoglucanase is used to illustrate two different ways in which cell walls may be made more extensible and the divergent effects on wall mechanics.},

  abstract = {The pollen tube is a fast tip-growing cell carrying the two sperm cells to the ovule allowing the double fertilization process and seed setting. To succeed in this process, the spatial and temporal controls of pollen tube growth within the female organ are critical. It requires a massive cell wall deposition to promote fast pollen tube elongation and a tight control of the cell wall remodeling to modify the mechanical properties. In addition, during its journey, the pollen tube interacts with the pistil, which plays key roles in pollen tube nutrition, guidance and in the rejection of the self-incompatible pollen. This review focuses on our current knowledge in the biochemistry and localization of the main cell wall polymers including pectin, hemicellulose, cellulose and callose from several pollen tube species. Moreover, based on transcriptomic data and functional genomic studies, the possible enzymes involved in the cell wall remodeling during pollen tube growth and their impact on the cell wall mechanics are also described. Finally, mutant analyses have permitted to gain insight in the function of several genes involved in the pollen tube cell wall biosynthesis and their roles in pollen tube growth are further discussed.},
