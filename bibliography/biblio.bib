  abstract = {THE VIEW THAT THE PLANT CELL GROWS BY THE YIELDING OF THE CELL WALL TO TURGOR PRESSURE CAN BE EXPRESSED IN THE EQUATION: rate = cell extensibility x turgor. All growth rate responses can in principle be resolved into changes in the 2 latter variables. Extensibility will relate primarily to the yielding properties of the cell wall, turgor primarily to solute uptake or production. Use of this simple relationship in vivo requires that at least 2 of the 3 variables be measured in a growing cell. Extensibility is not amenable to direct measurement. Data on rate and turgor for single Nitella cells can, however, be continuously gathered to permit calculation of extensibility (rate/turgor). Rate is accurately obtained from measurements on time-lapse film. Turgor is estimated in the same cell, to within 0.1 atm or less, by measurement of the ability of the cell to compress gas trapped in the closed end of a capillary the open end of which is in the cell vacuole. The method is independent of osmotic equilibrium. It operates continuously for several days, over a several fold increase in cell length, and has response time of less than one minute. Rapid changes in turgor brought on by changes in tonicity of the medium, show that extensibility, as defined above, is not constant but has a value of zero unless the cell has about 80\% of normal turgor. Because elastic changes are small, extensibility relates to growth. Over long periods of treatment in a variety of osmotica the threshold value for extensibility and growth is seen to fall to lower values to permit resumption of growth at reduced turgor. A brief period of rapid growth (5x normal) follows the return to normal turgor. All variables then become normal and the cycle can be repeated. The cell remains essentially at osmotic equilibrium, even while growing at 5x the normal rate. The method has potential for detailed in vivo analyses of ``wall softening.''},

  abstract = {A new method is described for continuously measuring cell turgor pressure (P), hydraulic conductivity (L(p)), and volumetric elastic modulus (epsilon) in higher plant cells, using a pressure probe. This technique permits volume changes, DeltaV, and turgor pressure changes, DeltaP, to be determined with an accuracy of 10(-5) to 10(-6) mul and 3 to 5.10(-2) bar, respectively.The main principle of the new method is the same as the pressure probe developed by Zimmermann and Steudle in which pressure is transmitted to a pressure transducer by means of an oil-filled capillary introduced into the cell. In order to use the pressure probe for small tissue cells, the effective compressible volume of the apparatus has to be sufficiently small in comparison to the volume of the cell itself. This is achieved by accurately fixing the oil/cell sap boundary in the very tip of the microcapillary by means of an electronic feedback mechanism, so that the effective volume of the apparatus is reduced to about 2 to 10\% of the cell volume. In this way also, errors arising from compressibility of the apparatus and temperature fluctuations can be excluded.Measurements on tissues cells of Capsicum annuum fruits yield epsilon values of 2 to 25 bar. Furthermore, epsilon can be shown to be a function of both cell turgor pressure and cell volume; epsilon increases with increasing turgor pressure and is higher in larger cells.},

Together with a suite of microanalytical techniques it has permitted the mapping of water and solute relations at the resolution of single cells and has the potential to link quantitatively the traditionally separate areas of water relations and metabolism. The development of the probe is outlined and its modification to measure root pressure and xylem tension described. The deployment of the pressure probe to determine and map turgor, hydraulic conductivity, reflection coefficient, cell rheological properties, solute concentrations and enzyme activities at the resolution of single cells is discussed. The controversy surrounding the interpretation of results obtained with the xylem-pressure probe is included. Possible further developments of the probe and applications of single cell sampling are suggested.},

  abstract = {The turgor pressure of growing pollen tubes of the lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) has been recorded using a turgor pressure probe. Insertion of the probe's micropipette was routinely accomplished, providing recording periods of 20 to 30 min. Probe insertion did not affect tube growth. The stable turgor values ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 MPa, the mean value being 0.209 +/- 0.064 MPa (n = 106). A brief increase in turgor, generated by injection of oil through the pressure probe, caused the tube to burst at its tip. Burst pressures ranged between 0.19 and 0.58 MPa, that is, individual lily pollen tubes do not withstand turgor pressure approaching twice their regular turgor pressure. In contrast, parallel experiments using the incipient plasmolysis technique yielded a mean putative turgor pressure of 0.79 MPa either using sucrose (n = 24) or mannitol (n = 25). Surprisingly, turgor pressure was not significantly correlated with tube growth rate which ranged from zero to 13 mu m/min. Nor did it correlate with tube length over the tested range of 100 to 1600 mu m In addition the influence of the medium's osmolality was surprisingly low: raising the external osmotic pressure from 0.36 to 1.08 MPa, with sucrose or mannitol, only caused mean turgor pressure to decline from 0.27 to 0.18 MPa. We conclude that growing lily pollen regulates its turgor pressure remarkably well despite substantial variation in tube growth rate, tube length, and osmotic milieu.},

@article{Lintilhac2000,
  abstract = {In this article we describe a new method for the determination of turgor pressures in living plant cells. Based on the treatment of growing plant cells as thin-walled pressure vessels, we find that pressures can be accurately determined by observing and measuring the area of the contact patch formed when a spherical glass probe is lowered onto the cell surface with a known force. Within the limits we have described, we can show that the load (determined by precalibration of the device) divided by the projected area of the contact patch (determined by video microscopy) provides a direct, rapid, and accurate measure of the internal turgor pressure of the cell. We demonstrate, by parallel measurements with the pressure probe, that our method yields pressure data that are consistent with those from the pressure probe. Also, by incubating target tissues in stepped concentrations of mannitol to incrementally reduce the turgor pressure we show that the pressures measured by tonometry accurately reflect the predicted changes from the osmotic potential of the bathing medium. The advantages of this new method over the pressure probe are considerable, however, in that we can move rapidly from cell to cell, taking measurements every 20 s. In addition, the nondestructive nature of the method means that we can return to the same cell repeatedly for periodic pressure measurements. The limitations of the method lie in the fact that it is suitable only for superficial cells that: are directly accessible to the probe and to cells that are relatively thin walled and not heavily decorated with surface features. It is also not suitable for measuring pressures in flaccid cells.},

To determine the effects of cell elasticity and turgor pressure on the cell's ability to bear load, we loaded a small glass ball onto a cell and measured the projected contact area between the ball and the cell. Unlike previous studies, we considered the cell as a whole entity, and utilized the Boussinesq's solution to derive the relevant equations that related the elastic parameters and cell deformation. For cells with a turgor pressure greater than or equal to 0.34 MPa, the predicted contact area agreed well with the measured area. The equations could also predict cell turgor pressure with a deviation from the measured value of 0.01 MPa. This study gives strong support to ball tonometry, a new method of measuring cell turgor pressure.},

  abstract = {Xyloglucan is widely believed to function as a tether between cellulose microfibrils in the primary cell wall, limiting cell enlargement by restricting the ability of microfibrils to separate laterally. To test the biomechanical predictions of this ``tethered network'' model, we assessed the ability of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) hypocotyl walls to undergo creep (long-term, irreversible extension) in response to three family-12 endo-beta-1,4-glucanases that can specifically hydrolyze xyloglucan, cellulose, or both. Xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase (XEG from Aspergillus aculeatus) failed to induce cell wall creep, whereas an endoglucanase that hydrolyzes both xyloglucan and cellulose (Cel12A from Hypocrea jecorina) induced a high creep rate. A cellulose-specific endoglucanase (CEG from Aspergillus niger) did not cause cell wall creep, either by itself or in combination with XEG. Tests with additional enzymes, including a family-5 endoglucanase, confirmed the conclusion that to cause creep, endoglucanases must cut both xyloglucan and cellulose. Similar results were obtained with measurements of elastic and plastic compliance. Both XEG and Cel12A hydrolyzed xyloglucan in intact walls, but Cel12A could hydrolyze a minor xyloglucan compartment recalcitrant to XEG digestion. Xyloglucan involvement in these enzyme responses was confirmed by experiments with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hypocotyls, where Cel12A induced creep in wild-type but not in xyloglucan-deficient (xxt1/xxt2) walls. Our results are incompatible with the common depiction of xyloglucan as a load-bearing tether spanning the 20- to 40-nm spacing between cellulose microfibrils, but they do implicate a minor xyloglucan component in wall mechanics. The structurally important xyloglucan may be located in limited regions of tight contact between microfibrils.},

  abstract = {Cellulose and xyloglucan (XG) assemble to form the cellulose/XG network, which is considered to be the dominant load-bearing structure in the growing cell walls of non-graminaceous land plants. We have extended the most commonly accepted model for the macromolecular organization of XG in this network, based on the structural and quantitative analysis of three distinct XG fractions that can be differentially extracted from the cell walls isolated from etiolated pea stems. Approximately 8\% of the dry weight of these cell walls consists of XG that can be solubilized by treatment of the walls with a XG-specific endoglucanase (XEG). This material corresponds to an enzyme-susceptible XG domain, proposed to form the cross-links between cellulose microfibrils. Another 10\% of the cell wall consists of XG that can be solubilized by concentrated KOH after XEG treatment. This material constitutes another XG domain, proposed to be closely associated with the surface of the cellulose microfibrils. An additional 3\% of the cell wall consists of XG that can be solubilized only when the XEG- and KOH-treated cell walls are treated with cellulase. This material constitutes a third XG domain, proposed to be entrapped within or between cellulose microfibrils. Analysis of the three fractions indicates that metabolism is essentially limited to the enzyme-susceptible domain. These results support the hypothesis that enzyme-catalyzed modification of XG cross-links in the cellulose/XG network is required for the growth and development of the primary plant cell wall, and demonstrate that the structural consequences of these metabolic events can be analyzed in detail.},

Hemicelluloses include xyloglucans, xylans, mannans and glucomannans, and beta-(1-->3,1-->4)-glucans. These types of hemicelluloses are present in the cell walls of all terrestrial plants, except for beta-(1-->3,1-->4)-glucans, which are restricted to Poales and a few other groups. The detailed structure of the hemicelluloses and their abundance vary widely between different species and cell types. The most important biological role of hemicelluloses is their contribution to strengthening the cell wall by interaction with cellulose, and, in some walls, with lignin. These features are discussed in relation to widely accepted models of the primary wall. Hemicelluloses are synthesized by glycosyltransferases located in the Golgi membranes. Many glycosyltransferases needed for biosynthesis of xyloglucans and mannans are known. In contrast, the biosynthesis of xylans and beta-(1-->3,1-->4)-glucans remains very elusive, and recent studies have led to more questions than answers.

  abstract = {The advent of user-friendly instruments for measuring force/deflection curves of plant surfaces at high spatial resolution has resulted in a recent outpouring of reports of the ‘Young’s modulus’ of plant cell walls. The stimulus for these mechanical measurements comes from biomechanical models of morphogenesis of meristems and other tissues, as well as single cells, in which cell wall stress feeds back to regulate microtubule organization, auxin transport, cellulose deposition, and future growth directionality. In this article I review the differences between elastic modulus and wall extensibility in the context of cell growth. Some of the inherent complexities, assumptions, and potential pitfalls in the interpretation of indentation force/deflection curves are discussed. Reported values of elastic moduli from surface indentation measurements appear to be 10- to >1000-fold smaller than realistic tensile elastic moduli in the plane of plant cell walls. Potential reasons for this disparity are discussed, but further work is needed to make sense of the huge range in reported values. The significance of wall stress relaxation for growth is reviewed and connected to recent advances and remaining enigmas in our concepts of how cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectins are assembled to make an extensible cell wall. A comparison of the loosening action of α-expansin and Cel12A endoglucanase is used to illustrate two different ways in which cell walls may be made more extensible and the divergent effects on wall mechanics.},

Schlupmann, A. Bacic, S.M. Read [1993] Planta 191: 470-481). Therefore, we investigated whether UDP-glucose was a likely substrate for callose synthesis in actively growing pollen tubes. Deposition of (1-3)-beta-glucan occurred at a constant rate, 1.4 to 1.7 nmol glucose min(-1), in tubes from 1 mg of pollen from 3 h after germination; however, the rate of incorporation of radioactivity from exogenous [C-14]sucrose into wall polymers was not constant, but increased until at least 8 h after germination, probably due to decreasing use of internal reserves. UDP-glucose was a prominent ultraviolet-absorbing metabolite in pollen-tube extracts, with 1.6 nmol present in tubes from 1 mg of pollen, giving a calculated cytoplasmic concentration of approximately 3.5 mM. Radioactivity from [C-14]sucrose was rapidly incorporated into sugar monophosphates and UDP-glucose by the growing tubes, consistent with a turnover time for UDP-glucose of less than 1 min; the specific radioactivity of extracted UDP-[C-14]glucose was equal to that calculated from the rate of incorporation of [C-14]sucrose into wall glucans. Large amounts of less metabolically active neutral sugars were also present. The rate of synthesis of (1-3)-beta-glucan by nontrypsin-treated pollen-tube membrane preparations incubated with 3.5 mM UDP-glucose and a beta-glucoside activator was slightly greater than the rate of deposition of (1-3)-beta-glucan by intact pollen tubes. These data are used to assess the physiological significance of proteolytic activation of pollen-tube callose synthase.},

Native plant cellulose forms nanometer-scale microfibrils that are embedded in a polymeric network of hemicelluloses, pectins, and lignins; this explains, in part, the recalcitrance of biomass to deconstruction. The chemical and structural characteristics of these plant cell wall constituents remain largely unknown today. Scanning probe microscopy techniques, particularly atomic force microscopy and its application in characterizing plant cell wall structure, are reviewed here.

The grapevine cell suspensions were continuously observed in their culture medium from 30 min to 24h after elicitation. In the beginning, cellulose fibrils covered by a matrix surrounded the control and treated cells. After 3 h, the elicited cells displayed sprouted expansions around the cell wall that correspond to pectin chains. These expansions were not observed on untreated grapevine cells. The AFM tip was used to determine the average surface elastic modulus of cell wall that account for cell wall mechanical properties. The elasticity is diminished in UV-treated cells. In a comparative study, grapevine cells showed the same decrease in cell wall elasticity when treated with a fungal biotic elicitor of defence response. These results demonstrate cell wall strengthening by UV stress.},

Here we designed an atomic force microscopy approach to investigate the elastic modulus of the outer cell wall in living shoot apical meristems (SAMs). SAMs are highly organized structures that contain the plant stem cells, and generate all of the aerial organs of the plant. Building on modeling and experimental data, we designed a protocol that is able to measure very local properties, i.e. within 40-100 nm deep into the wall of living meristematic cells. We identified three levels of complexity at the meristem surface, with significant heterogeneity in stiffness at regional, cellular and even subcellular levels. Strikingly, we found that the outer cell wall was much stiffer at the tip of the meristem (5 ± 2 MPa on average), covering the stem cell pool, than on the flanks of the meristem (1.5 ± 0.7 MPa on average). Altogether, these results demonstrate the existence of a multiscale spatialization of the mechanical properties of the meristem surface, in addition to the previously established molecular and cytological zonation of the SAM, correlating with regional growth rate distribution.},

The aerial organs of plants are formed at the shoot apical meristem following a specific phyllotactic pattern [10]. The initiation of an organ from the meristem requires a highly localized irreversible surface deformation, which depends on the demethylesterification of cell wall pectins [11]. Here, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate whether these chemical changes lead to changes in tissue mechanics. By mapping the viscoelasticity and elasticity in living meristems, we observed increases in tissue elasticity, correlated with pectin demethylesterification, in primordia and at the site of incipient organs. Measurements of tissue elasticity at various depths showed that, at the site of incipient primordia, the first increases occurred in subepidermal tissues. The results support the following causal sequence of events: (1) demethylesterification of pectin is triggered in subepidermal tissue layers, (2) this contributes to an increase in elasticity of these layers-the first observable mechanical event in organ initiation, and (3) the process propagates to the epidermis during the outgrowth of the organ.},

For the first time that we know of, this new imaging technique was performed on living single cells of a higher plant, permitting monitoring of the stiffness distribution in cell-wall layers as a function of the depth and its evolution during the different growth phases. The mechanical measurements were correlated with changes in the composition of the cell wall, which were revealed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In the beginning and end of cell growth, the average stiffness of the cell wall was low and the wall was mechanically homogenous, whereas in the exponential growth phase, the average wall stiffness increased, with increasing heterogeneity. In this phase, the difference between the superficial and deep wall stiffness was highest. FTIR spectra revealed a relative increase in the polysaccharide/lignin content.},

Expansion of cell walls is an essential component of growth, and the regulation of cell wall expansion is one of the ways in which the mechanics of growth is controlled, managed and directed. In this study, the inherent surface mechanical properties of living Arabidopsis thaliana whole-root epidermal cells were studied at the nanoscale using the technique of atomic force microscopy (AFM). A novel methodology was successfully developed to adapt AFM to live plant roots. Force-Indentation (F-I) experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanical properties along the length of the root. F-I curves for epidermal cells of roots were also generated by varying turgor pressure. The F-I curves displayed a variety of features due to the heterogeneity of the surface. Hysteresis is observed. Application of conventional models to living biological systems such as cell walls in nanometer regimes tends to increase error margins to a large extent. Hence information from the F-I curves were used in a preliminary semiquantitative analysis to infer material properties and calculate two parameters. The work done in the loading and unloading phases (hysteresis) of the force measurements were determined separately and were expressed in terms of “Index of Plasticity” (eta), which characterized the elasticity properties of roots as a viscoelastic response. Scaling approaches were used to find the ratio of hardness to reduced modulus (H/E*).},

The role of IAA was investigated by studying the changes in ultrastructure and PM H(+)-ATPase distribution in the pollen tubes and the modification of the tube wall. Using the fluorescent marker FM4-64, together with transmission electron microscopy, it was shown that secretory vesicles and mitochondria increased in IAA-treated tubes. Immunolocalization and fluorescence labelling, together with Fourier-transform infrared analysis, detected that IAA enhanced the level of PM H(+)-ATPase and the synthesis of pectins, and reduced the cellulose density in pollen tubes. Importantly, to observe the orientation of cellulose microfibrils in pollen tubes in situ, atomic force microscopy was used to examine the ‘intact’ tube wall. Atomic force microscopy images showed that cellulose microfibrils were parallel to each other in the subapical region of IAA-treated tubes, but disorganized in control tubes. All results provided new insights into the functions of cellulose microfibrils in pollen tube growth and direction, and revealed that the IAA-induced changes of pollen tubes were attributed to the increase in secretory vesicles, mitochondria, and PM H(+)-ATPase, and the modification of pectin and cellulose microfibrils in the tube wall.},

This polarized cellular organization reflects the highly anisotropic growth behavior of this tip growing cell. Accordingly, it has frequently been postulated that physical properties of pollen tubes such as cell wall plasticity should show anisotropic distribution, but no experimental evidence for this has been published hitherto. Using micro-indentation techniques, we quantify pollen tube resistance to lateral deformation forces and analyze its visco-elasticity as a function of distance from the growing apex. Our studies reveal that cellular stiffness is significantly higher at the distal portion of the cell. This part of the cell is also completely elastic, whereas the apex shows a visco-elastic component upon deformation. To relate these data to the architecture of the particular pollen tube investigated in this study, Papaver rhoeas, we analyzed the distribution of cell wall components such as pectin, callose, and cellulose as well as the actin cytoskeleton in this cell using fluorescence label. Our data revealed that, in particular, the degree of pectin methyl esterification and the configuration of the actin cytoskeleton correlate well with the distribution of the physical properties on the longitudinal axis of the cell.

Micro-indentation of these cells revealed that the initial formation of a cylindrical protuberance is preceded by a local reduction in cellular stiffness. Similar cellular softening was observed before the onset of a rapid growth phase in cells with oscillating growth pattern. These findings provide the first quantitative cytomechanical data that confirm the important role of the mechanical properties of the cell wall for local cellular growth processes. They are consistent with a conceptual model that explains pollen tube oscillatory growth based on the relationship between turgor pressure and tensile resistance in the apical cell wall. To further confirm the significance of cell mechanics, we artificially manipulated the mechanical cell wall properties as well as the turgor pressure. We observed that these changes affected the oscillation profile and were able to induce oscillatory behavior in steadily growing tubes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The cell wall is one of the structural key players regulating pollen tube growth, since plant cell expansion depends on an interplay between intracellular driving forces and the controlled yielding of the cell wall. Pectin is the main cell wall component at the growing pollen tube apex. We therefore assessed its role in pollen tube growth and cytomechanics using the enzymes pectinase and pectin methyl esterase (PME). Pectinase activity was able to stimulate pollen germination and tube growth at moderate concentrations whereas higher concentrations caused apical swelling or bursting in Solanum chacoense Bitt. pollen tubes. This is consistent with a modification of the physical properties of the cell wall affecting its extensibility and thus the growth rate, as well as its capacity to withstand turgor. To prove that the enzyme-induced effects were due to the altered cell wall mechanics, we subjected pollen tubes to micro-indentation experiments. We observed that cellular stiffness was reduced and visco-elasticity increased in the presence of pectinase. These are the first mechanical data that confirm the influence of the amount of pectins in the pollen tube cell wall on the physical parameters characterizing overall cellular architecture. Cytomechanical data were also obtained to analyze the role of the degree of pectin methyl-esterification, which is known to exhibit a gradient along the pollen tube axis. This feature has frequently been suggested to result in a gradient of the physical properties characterizing the cell wall and our data provide, for the first time, mechanical support for this concept. The gradient in cell wall composition from apical esterified to distal de-esterified pectins seems to be correlated with an increase in the degree of cell wall rigidity and a decrease of visco-elasticity. Our mechanical approach provides new insights concerning the mechanics of pollen tube growth and the architecture of living plant cells.},

  abstract = {While callose is a well-known permeability barrier and leak sealant in plant cells, it is largely unknown whether this cell wall polymer can also serve as a load-bearing structure. Since callose occurs in exceptionally large amounts in pollen, we assessed its role for resisting tension and compression stress in this cell. The effect of callose digestion in Solanum chacoense and Lilium orientalis pollen grains demonstrated that, depending on the species, this cell wall polymer represents a major stress-bearing structure at the aperture area of germinating grains. In the pollen tube, it is involved in cell wall resistance to circumferential tension stress, and despite its absence at the growing apex, callose is indirectly involved in the establishment of tension stress resistance in this area. To investigate whether or not callose is able to provide mechanical resistance against compression stress, we subjected pollen tubes to local deformation by microindentation. The data revealed that lowering the amount of callose resulted in reduced cellular stiffness and increased viscoelasticity, thus indicating clearly that callose is able to resist compression stress. Whether this function is relevant for pollen tube mechanics, however, is unclear, as stiffened growth medium caused a decrease in callose deposition. Together, our data provide clear evidence for the capacity of cell wall callose to resist tension and compression stress, thus demonstrating that this amorphous cell wall substance can have a mechanical role in growing plant cells.},

Despite recent work demonstrating a role for mechanical signals in morphogenesis, precise measurement of mechanical properties at the individual cell level remains a technical challenge. To address this challenge, we have developed cellular force microscopy (CFM), which combines the versatility of classical microindentation techniques with the high automation and resolution approaching that of atomic force microscopy. CFM’s large range of forces provides the possibility to map the apparent stiffness of both plasmolyzed and turgid tissue as well as to perform micropuncture of cells using very high stresses. CFM experiments reveal that, within a tissue, local stiffness measurements can vary with the level of turgor pressure in an unexpected way. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of detailed physically based simulations for the interpretation of microindentation results. CFM’s ability to be used both to assess and manipulate tissue mechanics makes it a method of choice to unravel the feedbacks between mechanics, genetics, and morphogenesis.},

  year = {2004},
  abstract = {Microindentation methods are commonly used to determine material properties of soft tissues at the cell or even sub-cellular level. In determining properties from force-displacement (FD) data, it is often assumed that the tissue is initially a stress-free, homogeneous, linear elastic half-space. Residual stress, however, can strongly influence such results. In this paper, we present a new microindentation method for determining both elastic properties and residual stress in soft tissues that, to a first approximation, can be regarded as a pre-stressed layer embedded in or adhered to an underlying relatively soft, elastic foundation. The effects of residual stress are shown using two linear elastic models that approximate specific biological structures. The first model is an axially loaded beam on a relatively soft, elastic foundation (i.e., stress-fiber embedded in cytoplasm), while the second is a radially loaded plate on a foundation (e.g., cell membrane or epithelium). To illustrate our method, we use a nonlinear finite element (FE) model and experimental FD and surface contour data to find elastic properties and residual stress in the early embryonic chick heart, which, in the region near the indenter tip, is approximated as an isotropic circular plate under tension on a foundation. It is shown that the deformation of the surface in a microindentation test can be used along with FD data to estimate material properties, as well as residual stress, in soft tissue structures that can be regarded as a plate under tension on an elastic foundation. This method may not be as useful, however for structures that behave as a beam on a foundation.},

  abstract = {Plant cell expansion is controlled by a fine-tuned balance between intracellular turgor pressure, cell wall loosening and cell wall biosynthesis. To understand these processes, it is important to gain in-depth knowledge of cell wall mechanics. Pollen tubes are tip-growing cells that provide an ideal system to study mechanical properties at the single cell level. With the available approaches it was not easy to measure important mechanical parameters of pollen tubes, such as the elasticity of the cell wall. We used a cellular force microscope (CFM) to measure the apparent stiffness of lily pollen tubes. In combination with a mechanical model based on the finite element method (FEM), this allowed us to calculate turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity, which we found to be around 0.3 MPa and 20-90 MPa, respectively. Furthermore, and in contrast to previous reports, we showed that the difference in stiffness between the pollen tube tip and the shank can be explained solely by the geometry of the pollen tube. CFM, in combination with an FEM-based model, provides a powerful method to evaluate important mechanical parameters of single, growing cells. Our findings indicate that the cell wall of growing pollen tubes has mechanical properties similar to rubber. This suggests that a fully turgid pollen tube is a relatively stiff, yet flexible cell that can react very quickly to obstacles or attractants by adjusting the direction of growth on its way through the female transmitting tissue.},

Performing indentation experiments on this theoretical model demonstrates that all four parameters influence stiffness measurement and can therefore not be neglected in the interpretation of micro-indentation data.},

  abstract = {Insect herbivores contend with various plant traits that are presumed to function as feeding deterrents. Paradoxically, some specialist insect herbivores might benefit from some of these plant traits, for example by sequestering plant chemical defenses that herbivores then use as their own defense against natural enemies. Larvae of the butterfly species Battus philenor (L.) (Papilionidae) sequester toxic alkaloids (aristolochic acids) from their Aristolochia host plants, rendering larvae and adults unpalatable to a broad range of predators. We studied the importance of two putative defensive traits in Aristolochia erecta: leaf toughness and aristolochic acid content, and we examined the effect of intra- and interplant chemical variation on the chemical phenotype of B. philenor larvae. It has been proposed that genetic variation for sequestration ability is “invisible to natural selection” because intra- and interindividual variation in host-plant chemistry will largely eliminate a role for herbivore genetic variation in determining an herbivore’s chemical phenotype. We found substantial intra- and interplant variation in leaf toughness and in the aristolochic acid chemistry in A. erecta. Based on field observations and laboratory experiments, we showed that first-instar larvae preferentially fed on less tough, younger leaves and avoided tougher, older leaves, and we found no evidence that aristolochic acid content influenced first-instar larval foraging. We found that the majority of variation in the amount of aristolochic acid sequestered by larvae was explained by larval family, not by host-plant aristolochic acid content. Heritable variation for sequestration is the predominant determinant of larval, and likely adult, chemical phenotype. This study shows that for these highly specialized herbivores that sequester chemical defenses, traits that offer mechanical resistance, such as leaf toughness, might be more important determinants of early-instar larval foraging behavior and development compared to plant chemical defenses.},

Despite its importance in plant reproduction, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate the navigation of the pollen tube through the stigma, style, and transmitting tract. Here, we report the identification and characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana gene, VANGUARD1 (VGD1) that encodes a pectin methylesterase (PME)-homologous protein of 595 amino acids and is required for enhancing the growth of pollen tubes in the style and transmitting tract tissues. VGD1 was expressed specifically in pollen grain and the pollen tube. The VGD1 protein was distributed throughout the pollen grain and pollen tube, including the plasma membrane and cell wall. Functional interruption of VGD1 reduced PME activity in the pollen to 82% of the wild type and greatly retarded the growth of the pollen tube in the style and transmitting tract, resulting in a significant reduction of male fertility. In addition, the vgd1 pollen tubes were unstable and burst more frequently when germinated and grown on in vitro culture medium, compared with wild-type pollen tubes. Our study suggests that the VGD1 product is required for growth of the pollen tube, possibly via modifying the cell wall and enhancing the interaction of the pollen tube with the female style and transmitting tract tissues.},

A microscopic method was developed that uses elastic optical waveguides to visualize and measure forces locally exerted by single appressoria. By this method, the force exerted by appressoria of C. graminicola was found to be about 17 micronewtons.},

We have built a simple, compact, easy-to-use, safe and robust optical tweezer system that can be used with brightfield, phase contrast, differential interference contrast and fluorescence optics on a standard research grade light microscope. We have used this optical tweezer system in a range of cell biology applications to trap and micromanipulate whole fungal cells, organelles within cells, and beads. We have demonstrated how optical tweezers can be used to: unambiguously determine whether hyphae are actively homing towards each other; move the Spitzenkörper and change the pattern of hyphal morphogenesis; make piconewton force measurements; mechanically stimulate hyphal tips; and deliver chemicals to localized regions of hyphae. Significant novel experimental findings from our study were that germ tubes generated significantly smaller growth forces than leading hyphae, and that both hyphal types exhibited growth responses to mechanical stimulation with optically trapped polystyrene beads. Germinated spores that had been optically trapped for 25min exhibited no deleterious effects with regard to conidial anastomosis tube growth, homing or fusion.},

  abstract = {Cellular growth and movement require both the control of direction and the physical capacity to generate forces. In animal cells directional control and growth forces are generated by the polymerization of and traction between the elements of the cytoskeleton. Whether actual forces generated by the cytoskeleton play a role in plant cell growth is largely unknown as the interplay between turgor and cell wall is considered to be the predominant structural feature in plant cell morphogenesis. We investigated the mechano-structural role of the cytoskeleton in the invasive growth of pollen tubes. These cells elongate rapidly by tip growth and have the ability to penetrate the stigmatic and stylar tissues in order to drill their way to the ovule. We used agents interfering with cytoskeletal functioning, latrunculin B and oryzalin, in combination with mechanical in vitro assays. While microtubule degradation had no significant effect on the pollen tubes’ capacity to invade a mechanical obstacle, latrunculin B decreased the pollen tubes’ ability to elongate in stiffened growth medium and to penetrate an obstacle. On the other hand, the ability to maintain a certain growth direction in vitro was affected by the degradation of microtubules but not actin filaments. To find out whether both cytoskeletal elements share functions or interact we used both drugs in combination resulting in a dramatic synergistic response. Fluorescent labeling revealed that the integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton depends on the presence of actin filaments. In contrast, actin filaments seemed independent of the configuration of microtubules.},

  abstract = {Tip-growing cells have the unique property of invading living tissues and abiotic growth matrices. To do so, they exert significant penetrative forces. In plant and fungal cells, these forces are generated by the hydrostatic turgor pressure. Using the TipChip, a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip device developed for tip-growing cells, we tested the ability to exert penetrative forces generated in pollen tubes, the fastest-growing plant cells. The tubes were guided to grow through microscopic gaps made of elastic polydimethylsiloxane material. Based on the deformation of the gaps, the force exerted by the elongating tubes to permit passage was determined using finite element methods. The data revealed that increasing mechanical impedance was met by the pollen tubes through modulation of the cell wall compliance and, thus, a change in the force acting on the obstacle. Tubes that successfully passed a narrow gap frequently burst, raising questions about the sperm discharge mechanism in the flowering plants.},

Interactions between expanding cells at the tissue level or even the entire organism are extremely complex. This chapter explains the principles of growth at the single-cell level. The atomic force microscope (AFM) has been used both as an imaging tool and for measuring forces with exceptionally high resolution. Computer simulation techniques are often employed to study plant development. Microrobotic platforms enable the precise characterization and mechanical stimulation of single cells, tissues, and whole organs. The cellular force microscope (CFM) is used to characterize the mechanical properties of biological cells and tissues with an increased level of automation. CFM combined with fluorescence microscopy provides a tool for studying the effects of mechanical stimulation on physiological parameters. The CFM platform is compatible with various imaging systems and enables a powerful screening technology.},

  abstract = {Turgor pressure in plant cells is involved in many important processes. Stable and normal turgor pressure is required for healthy growth of a plant, and changes in turgor pressure are indicative of changes taking place within the plant tissue. The ability to quantify the turgor pressure of plant cells in vivo would provide opportunities to understand better the process of pressure regulation within plants, especially when plant stress is considered, and to understand the role of turgor pressure in cellular signaling. Current experimental methods do not separate the influence of the turgor pressure from the effects associated with deformation of the cell wall when estimates of turgor pressure are made. In this paper, nanoindentation measurements are combined with finite element simulations to determine the turgor pressure of cells in vivo while explicitly separating the cell-wall properties from the turgor pressure effects. Quasi-static cyclic tests with variable depth form the basis of the measurements, while relaxation tests at low depth are used to determine the viscoelastic material properties of the cell wall. Turgor pressure is quantified using measurements on Arabidopsis thaliana under three pressure states (control, turgid and plasmolyzed) and at various stages of plant development. These measurements are performed on cells in vivo without causing damage to the cells, such that pressure changes may be studied for a variety of conditions to provide new insights into the biological response to plant stress conditions.},
