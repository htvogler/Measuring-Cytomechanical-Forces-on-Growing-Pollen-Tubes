Dual-axis force sensor for simultaneous measurements of vertical and lateral forces. To be able to measure the forces at the curved tip of pollen tubes it is necessary to measure vertical and lateral force components to calculate the force perpendicular to the cell wall. **a** close-up of the 2D-force sensor showing the arrangement of the capacitor arrays (comb-drive capacitors). The sensor probe is attached to the capacitor arrays measuring the vertical force component. The lateral force sensing capacitor arrays are arranged on the left and on the right and connected to the central part via flexures. **b** schematic of the dual-axis MEMS-based force sensor (prototype, FemtoTools).
