Dual-axis force sensor for simultaneous measurements of vertical and lateral forces. To be able to measure the forces at the curved tip of pollen tubes, values for the vertical and lateral force components need to be known to calculate the force perpendicular to the cell wall. **a** Close-up of the dual-axis force sensor, showing the arrangement of the capacitor arrays (comb-drive capacitors). The sensor probe is attached to the capacitor arrays measuring the vertical force component. The lateral force sensing capacitor arrays are arranged on the left and on the right and are connected to the central part via flexures. **b** Scheme of the dual-axis MEMS-based force sensor (prototype, FemtoTools).
