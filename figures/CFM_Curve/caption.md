A typical force against indentation plot from a CFM measurement taken in the tip region of a lily pollen tube. The apparent stiffness of the pollen tube, resulting from a combination of turgor pressure, cell wall stiffness, and cell and sensor geometry, is calculated by applying a linear fit to the loading and/or unloading curve. Hysteresis suggests a degree of viscoelasticity in the cell wall.
