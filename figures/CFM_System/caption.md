The Real-Time Cellular Force Microscope (RT-CFM). **a** An overview of the positioning and measuring unit. The force sensor (blue) is mounted to an aluminium arm, which is attached to a three-degrees-of-freedom micropositioner that is used to bring the sensor probe close to the sample. To make measurements, the sample is moved against the probe via a piezo-driven fine positioning stage. **b** Close-up of the capacitive microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based microforce sensor (FT-S100, FemtoTools). A tungsten tip is glued to the actual sensor probe (red square). **c** Magnification of the tungsten tip.
