The Real-Time Cellular Force Microscope. An overview of the positioning and measuring unit is shown in **a**. The force sensor (blue) is mounted to an aluminium arm that is attached to a three-degrees-of-freedom micropositioner, which is used to bring the sensor probe close to the samples. For taking the measurements the sample is moved against the probe via a piezo-driven fine positioning stage. **b** shows a close-up of the capacitive microelectromechanical systems-based microforce sensor (FT-S100, FemtoTools). A tungsten tip is glued to the actual sensor probe (red square), the tip of which is magnified in **c**.
