Multichannel Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) device to parallelize pollen tube growth. **a** Part of a multichannel LoC designed for lily pollen. The pollen grains are loaded into the circular reservoir where they will germinate and the pollen tubes will grow into the individual channels. **b** Close-up of an array of channels with three growing lily pollen tubes is shown in. **c** Scheme of the multichannel LoC in a CFM experiment. The sensor probe is placed in front of the channel and measurements are taken when the pollen tube emerges. Scale bars = 100 Âµm
