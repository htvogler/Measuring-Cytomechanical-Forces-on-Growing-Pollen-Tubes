Multichannel Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) to parallelize pollen tube growth. Panel **a** shows part of a multichannel LoC designed for lily pollen. The pollen grains are loaded into the circular reservoir where they will germinate and the pollen tubes will grow into the individual channels. A close-up of an array of channels with three growing lily pollen tubes is shown in **b**. **c** scheme of the multichannel LoC in a CFM experiment. The sensor probe is placed in front of the channel and measurements are taken when the pollen tube emerges. Scale bars = 100 Âµm
