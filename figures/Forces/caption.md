Path of the pollen tube from the stigma to the ovule and the forces that are involved in pollen tube--female tissue interaction. **a** Overview of a solid pistil. Compatible pollen germinates on the stigma and penetrates the papillary cells. A pollen tubes grows through the style to the ovary in the transmitting tract where it is attracted by an ovule. **b** Close-up of a papillary cell with a germinated pollen grain on top. The grain adheres to the surface of the papillary cell while the pollen tube penetrates the cell wall to grow within the papillary cell. When a pollen tube hits a cell in the transmitting tract it can either change growth direction and grow between the female cells or penetrate them and grow inside **(c)**. Following a gradient of chemical attractants, the pollen tubes exits from the transmitting tract, adheres and grows along the funiculus to the micropylar opening where it penetrates a synergid  to release the sperm cells into the embryo sac **(d)**. Pollen grains and tubes are shown in orange.
