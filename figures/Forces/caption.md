Path of the pollen tube from the stigma to the ovule, illustrating the forces involved in the interactions between pollen tube and female tissues. **a** Overview of a pistil with a solid style. Compatible pollen germinates on the stigma and penetrates the papilla cells. A pollen tubes grows through the style and transmitting tract into the ovary in the transmitting tract where it is attracted by an ovule. **b** Close-up of a papilla cell with a germinated pollen grain. The grain adheres to the surface of the papilla cell while the pollen tube penetrates the cell to grow within the cell wall or between the cell wall and plasma membrane. **c** When a pollen tube encounters a cell in the transmitting tract, it can either change growth direction and grow between the cells or penetrate them and grow within the cell wall or between the cell wall and plasma membrane. **d** After exiting the transmitting tract, the pollen tube follows a gradient of chemical attractants, adhering and growing along the funiculus into the micropylar opening of the ovule, where it penetrates a synergid cell to release the sperm cells into the embryo sac. Pollen grains and tubes are shown in orange.
